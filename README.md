# StudentSurvey

 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a collaborative effort among OECD member
countries to measure how well 15-year-old students approaching the end of compulsory schooling are prepared to meet
the challenges of todayâ€™s knowledge societies. The assessment is forward-looking: rather than focusing on the extent to
which these students have mastered a specific school curriculum, it looks at their ability to use their knowledge and skills
to meet real-life challenges. This orientation reflects a change in curricular goals and objectives, which are increasingly
concerned with what students can do with what they learn at school.

PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.   Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

# In the repo

A details deconstruction is given in the repo. I have come up with some questions that I was able to think about.
I have tried to answer them with the best of my abilities.

Feel free to fork the repo and star it if you like it.
